main â†’ stable, production-ready code
dev â†’ integration branch (where features get merged before main)
feature/* â†’ per feature or task
	feature/auth-api
	feature/product-crud

fix/* â†’ for bug fixes
	fix/login-bug

hotfix/* â†’ urgent production bug

ðŸ‘‰ Flow:
Create branch from dev â†’ work â†’ commit â†’ PR/Merge into dev.
After testing, merge dev â†’ main.
Tag version (v1.0.0).

 2. Commit Message Convention
Follow Conventional Commits (industry standard):
	<type>(scope): short description

Types use:
	feat â†’ new feature
	fix â†’ bug fix
	docs â†’ documentation changes
	style â†’ code style (formatting, linting, no logic changes)
	refactor â†’ code change (not bug/feature)
	test â†’ adding/editing tests
	chore â†’ maintenance tasks (deps, config, CI/CD)

Example
feat(auth): add mobile OTP verification API
fix(product): resolve price update bug
docs(api): update README with sales endpoints
refactor(db): optimize query for stock history
chore(ci): add GitHub Actions for linting


3.Commit Rules

1.Keep commits small and focused (1 logical change = 1 commit).
2.Use imperative mood (e.g., "add", not "added").
3.Add detailed body if needed:

Example
	feat(sale): add invoice generation
	
	- generate invoice as PDF
	- store invoice id in sales table
	- add download endpoint
