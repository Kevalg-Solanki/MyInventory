1.Codebase Scalability
	Moduler Architecture: Split backend into modules to make it easier to maintain and expand
	Controller-Service-Model Pattern: Use service layer to separate business logic from routes,making it reusable
	API Versioning: Use URLs like /api/v1 to allow future versions without breaking old clients.
	Reusable Components (Frontend): Build React components that can be reused across tenants or features.
	
2.Database Scalability
	Cloud Database: Auto scales storage and connections as traffic grows.
	Indexing: Add indexes for frequently queried fields to boost performance.
	Sharding: MongoDB supports horizontal sharding for very large datasets.
	Backups: Enable automatic daily backups and retention policies
	
3.Backend Scalability
	Microservices(Later): Split major services into separate deployable units if app grows large.
	Caching Layer: Integrate Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.
	Asynchronous Processing: Use job queues for heavy tasks.
	
4.Frontend Scalability
	Code Splitting: Use dynamic imports and lazy loading for faster load times.
	State Management: Centralized store for predictable performance.
	Global Error Handling: Gracefully handle backend errors and show user-friendly messages.
	CDN Hosting: Vercel's CDN automatically scales to handle high traiffic globally.

5.Security & Compliance
	Rate Limiting & Throttling: Prevent abuse by limiting API calls per user/IP.
	Data Validation: Use middleware to validate all requests.
	Role-Based Access Control: Enforce tenant-level access and permission checks.
	Audit Logging: Keep track of all changes for security audits and debugging.

6.Future Enhancements
	-Add multi-region deployment for faster access worldwide.
	-Support offline mode for critical actions using caching.
	-Introduce analytics dashboards for tenant insights.
	-Move heavy file processing to background jobs.
